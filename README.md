# Real-Time Chat Application with React Native

This project is a chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time on mobile platforms. It is developed using **React Native** and **Expo**, supporting both Android and iOS devices. Thanks to Firebase integration, the app offers real-time data synchronization and user authentication services. The application is built with various libraries and tools to ensure the high-performance user experience required in modern mobile applications.

## Features of the Application

### 1. Real-Time Communication
The app enables real-time messaging by utilizing Firebase's **Cloud Firestore** service.

### 2. Authentication and User Management
Users can securely log in and sign up using email and password through Firebase's **Authentication** service.

### 3. Offline Access and Data Storage
Messages are stored locally on the device using **Async Storage**, allowing users to access their chat history even when offline.

### 4. Customizable and Interactive Interface
The chat interface is designed using the **Gifted Chat** library, providing a customizable and interactive messaging experience.

### 5. Multi-Screen Navigation Support
Using **React Navigation**, the app offers a user-friendly experience for navigating between different screens. A tab-based navigation structure is implemented using **Bottom Tabs**, allowing for fast switching between screens. Additionally, **Native Stack** is used for stack-based navigation, playing a critical role in managing user flow.

### 6. Smooth Animations for Enhanced User Experience
**Reanimated** is utilized to create smooth transitions and animations in the app. This library ensures high-performance, fluid animations that enhance interactivity and provide a seamless user experience.
